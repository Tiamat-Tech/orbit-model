# Welcome to the Orbit Model

The Orbit Model is a framework for building high gravity communities. A high gravity community is one that excels at attracting and retaining members by providing an outstanding member experience. The project is no longer under active development but the website is still up for your perusal.

## Explore the model

**Visit the website: [https://orbit-model.vercel.app/](https://orbit-model.vercel.app/)**

There was also an earlier version of the website, which is available here: [https://orbit-model-archived.vercel.app/](https://orbit-model-archived.vercel.app/)

The model will help you answer questions like:

- How do I measure my community's engagement and growth?
- How do I attract new people to my community?
- Which members should I prioritize spending time with?
- What contribution should I ask each community member to make?

## Who can use the Orbit Model?

**Product and developer communities**.
Form a community of your most enthusiastic users and developers.

**Community-driven businesses**.
Learn who your most influential customers and help increase their reach.

**Open source projects**.
Build relationships that help convert users into contributors.

**And anyone else focused on growing their community!**

## About the Orbit Model

The Orbit Model was developed by developer advocates for working with communities of software developers, but the principles apply to most things that are community-shaped. The model was first used in 2014 and put on GitHub in November 2019 so anyone can use it and contribute back. We aim to make this framework useful to open source maintainers, developer advocates, community managers, founders, and anyone interested in building a community. It is sponsored and maintained by
[Orbit](https://orbit.love/).
